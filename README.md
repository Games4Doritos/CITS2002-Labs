# CITS2002-Labs
Lab assignments for the unit Systems Programming at UWA (CITS2200), written in C.

Directory Structure:

|
|------ Lab1
|   
|------ Lab2
|
|------ Lab3

Each folder has a C source file markedLab<x>. (x = number), and corresponding input.txt and/or output.txt files.

Obviously, you can compile the C source files any way you want, this is how I compile:

- Open the Visual Studio Command Prompt in the relevent directory
- Execute `cl markedLab<x>.c`. This will create/overwite a binary in the directory called markedLab<x>.exe

See individual directories for instrcutions on running
